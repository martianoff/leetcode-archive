# LeetCode Solutions Archive

Leetcode profile https://leetcode.com/u/maxmtmn/

These solutions have been collected over years and might have slightly different style, which evolved over time.
Currently, contains `Scala` solutions only.

Welcome to our open-source project - a curated collection of solutions for problems posed on `LeetCode`, all written in
the functional and object-oriented programming language, `Scala`.

This project is a treasure trove for all those interested in improving their algorithmic problem-solving skills,
developers preparing for their next coding interview, or anyone who is a lover of logic and puzzles.

This repository contains numerous individual Scala files, each tailored to solve a unique LeetCode problem. The Scala
files are conveniently named following the Leet's numbering system (`Leet<problem_number>.scala`), which makes it quite
straightforward to find solutions to your problem of interest.

Remember, the purpose of this project is not to endorse the mere copying of solutions but to learn, understand and
internalize the logic and elegance of problem-solving in `Scala`. So, seize this opportunity to deepen your knowledge
and become a better developer.

I welcome your contributions and encourage you to submit pull requests to enhance the quality and diversity of
solutions. Happy learning and coding!
